## Common Issues

### None of the bookmark tiles will load images

Go to the addons page (`about:addons`), and select Super Speedy Dial. In the permissions tab there is an optional permission called "Access your data for all websites". Turn that on, then in the dial page open the settings and select the trash icon button in the bottom right. Additionally, the fuzzy search will likely be missing favicons so select the refresh button next to the search field.
