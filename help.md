## Common Issues

### Bookmark tile images not loading

This can happen if you are not connected to the internet when the addon attempts to retrieve images. You can right click on individual bookmark tiles to reload their images or in the toolbar on the upper right find the "Reload" button and use it to bulk reload images.

### Search icon favicons are all missing

This happens for the same reasons as the issue above. Open the search modal and select the refresh button next to the search field to refresh the favicon images.
