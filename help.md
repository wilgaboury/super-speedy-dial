## Common Issues

### Bookmark tile images not loading

There are two main reasons that this can occur. First, if the permission "Access your data for all websites" is not turned on; second, if you are not connected to the internet when the addon attempts to retrieve images. Go to the addons page (`about:addons`), and select Super Speedy Dial. In the permissions tab ensure that "Access your data for all websites" is enabled. Then in the new tab page open the settings drawer, select the trash icon button in the bottom right, and confirm the deletion of tile images.

### Search icon favicons are all missing

This happens for the same reasons as the issue above. Go to the addons page (`about:addons`), and select Super Speedy Dial. In the permissions tab ensure that "Access your data for all websites" is enabled. Then open the search modal and select the refresh button next to the search field to retrieve the favicon images.
