## Contributing

I'm a solo developer working on this in my free time. It is a passion of mine, but it's also not my job; therefore, I'll try to add features suggested by users, but I will not be implementing any or all feature requests that get submitted. That being said, if you have an idea for a feature and some coding skills, feel free to create a branch off of master and implement it yourself. I will gladly answer questions, provide feedback and do code review.
