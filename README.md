# Super Speedy Dial

Download Here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/super-speedy-dial/

This is a firefox plugin that replaces the default new tab page with a speed dial home page inspired by the Opera browser. It is designed to seemlessly integrate with your current firefox bookmarks.

## Main External Libraries Used

- [Solidjs](https://www.solidjs.com) - A reactive javascript framework. This library has impressive benchmark performace and is designed to be developer friendly.
- [Muuri](https://muuri.dev/) - Configurable and flexible layouting library. Used to layout tiles, drag and drop them, and provides nice animations.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Uses the free set of icons.

## Rationale

The main reason I made this was for my own convenience. Having your browser homescreen be an easy graphical way to both access and edit bookmarks is a feature that popular browsers like firefox, chrome, and edge are missing (safari has favorites which is similar but lacking in features). Most of the speed dial plugins on the Firefox store do not fully integrate with your current firefox bookmarks or are missing critical functionality (in my opinion). I figured if wanted somthing done right I should just do it myself.

## Current Features

- navigatable grid display of bookmarks and folders
- settings page
  - upload background image
  - Set root folder for speed dial display (this is synced between decives)
- bookmark/folder are deletable and their titles are editable
- graphical reordering of bookmarks (drag and drop) with pleasant animations

## Planned Features (In order of importance)

- new folder button and drag and drop into folder
- thumbnail customization for boomark tiles
- toggleable dark mode / light mode
